# Connectors

A connector reads one source and returns a Snapshot, the format in [`data-contract.md`](data-contract.md). kestrel
asks every source in your `profile.toml` each time a page loads. A source that can't be read shows as an error in the
sidebar's Sources block, and the rest of the page still works. Every connector only reads: none of them writes to its
source.

| `kind` | Reads | Since |
|---|---|---|
| `demo` | nothing: a fictional year for "Alex" | Phase 2; the default when there is no `profile.toml` |
| `fdc` | [financial-data-collector](https://github.com/Dimas-100/financial-data-collector)'s SQLite warehouse | Phase 4a |
| `feed` | any system that serves the contract as JSON (your trading desk) | Phase 4b |
| `rails` | a trading-rails install: paper books, the run log, backtests | Phase 4b |

`kestrel check` tries every source and prints what it found; `kestrel serve --demo` and `kestrel check --demo` show
the demo whatever `profile.toml` says.

## `demo`

```toml
[[sources]]
id = "demo"
kind = "demo"
label = "Demo data"
```

Accounts, holdings, books, trades and runs for a believable year, with the dates moving so the last day is today.

## `fdc`: financial-data-collector

```toml
[[sources]]
id = "portfolio"
kind = "fdc"
label = "Portfolio"
path = "../financial-data-collector/data/warehouse.db"   # relative to this profile's folder
stale_after = "36h"

[sources.categories]          # optional: account id or exact label = long_term | trading | cash | other
"brokerage-2" = "trading"
```

- **`path`** is the warehouse file. A relative path is relative to the folder `profile.toml` is in, not to wherever
  you start kestrel.
- **Read-only.** The file is opened with `mode=ro` and `query_only` on top, once per page load, and closed straight
  after. A sync running at the same time is fine: kestrel reads what the collector last committed.
- **Needs** schema version 3 or later: the tables `accounts`, `transactions`, `prices`, `sync_runs`, `holdings_daily`
  and `cash_daily`, and the views `positions_latest` and `account_values_daily`.

### Accounts

| kestrel shows | from the warehouse |
|---|---|
| id | the account's label as a slug: `Alex Roth IRA` is `alex-roth-ira`, `Épargne` is `epargne`; a label with no letters or digits is `account`. Two labels that make the same slug get `-2`, `-3` in the order the collector first saw them. The id is the account's address: `/accounts/alex-roth-ira`. |
| name | the label |
| institution | `fidelity` is Fidelity, `webull` Webull, anything else title-cased; `unknown` is left out |
| type | `roth_ira` is Roth IRA, `traditional_ira` Traditional IRA, `401k` 401(k), `brokerage` Brokerage, `crypto` Crypto (and the other retirement types the same way); anything else title-cased |
| category | set in `[sources.categories]` by id or label (an id wins over a label), else from the type: retirement accounts, an HSA, a pension and `brokerage` are long-term; `checking`, `savings`, `cash` and `money_market` are cash; anything else, crypto included, is other |

Trading money is whatever you file under `trading`. Until a real trading book has a history of its own, Home's
"Trading vs your index money" draws the trading accounts.

`kestrel check` refuses a category that isn't one of the four, and notes a `categories` entry that matches no
account on the source's line.

### Values, history and money moved

- **Value and cash:** the newer of the broker's last snapshot (`account_values_daily`) and the last replayed day
  (`holdings_daily` plus `cash_daily`). When both are from the same day, the snapshot wins. A value is as of that
  day's US close.
- **History:** each account's holdings plus its cash, per day.
- **Money moved in and out,** from `transactions`, so deposits never count as growth:
  - a `contribution` counts as its signed amount (a negative one is a reversal),
  - a `withdrawal` is always money out,
  - a `transfer` keeps its sign; a transfer of shares with no cash amount moves no money,
  - money moved on a day without history (a Saturday deposit) counts on the next day that has one; money moved
    after the last day is left for the next sync.
- **Holdings:** the positions in each account's latest snapshot (`positions_latest`). A position with no market
  value is left out and counted in the source's detail; one with no price is priced at its value over its quantity.
  When the replayed history is newer than the last snapshot, the holdings are a day or two older than the value.

### Benchmark

When the warehouse has prices for your profile's `[benchmark]` symbol, kestrel draws it from their adjusted closes
(dividends included, as they are in the accounts), over the same days as your accounts' history. Pick a symbol the
collector already prices, such as an index fund you hold. Otherwise there is no benchmark line, and the source's
detail says `no SPY prices in the warehouse`.

### Freshness

The source's last success is when the collector last finished its `derive` step without an error (the step that
rebuilds the daily history), else any step that finished without one. After `stale_after` it turns amber. A
warehouse that has never finished a step shows as stale.

### Troubleshooting

Run `kestrel check`. Under the source's line it lists each account as `id  category  name`, never a balance.

| `kestrel check` says | What to do |
|---|---|
| `no warehouse at …` | Check `path`: it is relative to the folder `profile.toml` is in. |
| `… is not a financial-data-collector warehouse` | The file isn't a collector warehouse (or is empty): check `path`. |
| `this warehouse is at schema version 2 …` or `this warehouse is missing holdings_daily …` | Update financial-data-collector and run `fdc sync`. |
| `the warehouse couldn't be read: database is locked` | Another program held the file for more than five seconds. Refresh once it is done. |
| `unknown category 'trade' for 'Brokerage'` | Use `long_term`, `trading`, `cash` or `other` in `[sources.categories]`. |
| `no account matches categories 'brokerage-9'` | Use an id from the account lines, or the exact label. |
| `no SPY prices in the warehouse` | Set `[benchmark] symbol` to something the collector prices, or add it to the collector. |

## `feed` and `rails`

Phase 4b. Until then a source of either kind shows as an error that says it isn't available in this version.
